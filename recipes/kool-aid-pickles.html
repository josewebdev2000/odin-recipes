    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Kool Aid What??</p>

    <p>Who would ever dare to mix sweet and salty food this way? I'll tell you who would. We would.</p>
    <p>If you are brave enough to try Kool Aid Pickles then do so my pal.</p>
    <p>What's stopping you?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong>(46 ounce) jar whole dill pickles</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> cup sugar</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> cups water</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> (1 ounce) packets kool-aid unsweetened cherry drink mix</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Drain and discard the juice from the pickle jar. Remove the pickles from the jar and cut each one in half lengthwise. Return the pickles to the jar and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large measuring cup, combine the sugar, water and Kool-Aid. Mix until the sugar has completely dissolved. Pour enough of the liquid into the pickle jar to cover the pickles. Discard any excess.</li>
        <li>Cover the jar and refrigerate at least 24 hours.</li>
    </ol>
